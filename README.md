## Three things you learned:
  * Working as a team
  * Being very careful to avoid merge conflicts
  * Syncing up with team members to split work
  
## Two topics you want to research further
  * General Git workflow
  * Nested comments
  
## What did you enjoy in the project?
  * I enjoyed the opportunity to work with a team and develop a basic git workflow,
  especially in preperation for the group project next week. I particularly enjoy back-end.
  
 * Working out the logic and validations were fun.
 
 * Having out people to work with, and being able to ask questions and help figure things out as a group.
 
 * Working in this group was very fun and engaging. The people are very cool and hardworking.
liked the back-end


##TO GET STARTED:
* DO NOT FORK, "git clone" from this branch: https://github.com/asbudik/micro_blog_group_repo
* follow the "general workflow"

*  DO NOT MAKE A PULL REQUEST. (PULL REQUESTS ARE FROM FORKED REPOS TO THEIR ORIGINAL REPOS. WE SHOULD NOT BE WORKING ON FORKED REPOS.)

## General workflow:
by "feature" we mean "feature_branch_YourName"

* "git checkout -b feature"  to go to feature (-b is only necessary first time when you are creating you branch)
*  make changes in feature
*  "git add -A"
*  "git commit -m "description of the commit" "
*  in our feature "git push origin feature" to update the feature on github

*(git push -u origin feature on the first time you push!!!)

*  "git checkout master" to go back to master
*  "git pull" to synchronize master with github
*  "git checkout feature" to go back to feature
*  "git rebase master" to synchronize feature with the master.
